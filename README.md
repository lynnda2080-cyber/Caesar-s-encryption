# Caesar Cipher Tool

A lightweight Python application that implements the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## 📖 How it Works
The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B'.

## ✨ Features
- **Full Alphabet Support**: Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Symbol Preservation**: Spaces, numbers, and punctuation remain unchanged.
- **Bi-directional**: Supports both encryption (`e`) and decryption (`d`).
